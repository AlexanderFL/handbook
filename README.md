# √çsland.is Handbook

This GitHub organization is the center of development for digital government services on `island.is`. It is managed by the [Digital Iceland](https://stafraent.island.is/) department inside the [Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs](https://www.government.is/ministries/ministry-of-finance-and-economic-affairs/).

These services will be [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) and open to contributions, but most development will be performed by teams that win tenders to develop new functionality for Digital Iceland.

This handbook is designed to help new teams and open source contributors get into the project, as well as document project architecture and decisions.
