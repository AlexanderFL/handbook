# √çsland.is

[This repository](https://github.com/island-is/island.is) is the center of development for digital government services on `island.is`. It is managed by the [Digital Iceland](https://stafraent.island.is/) department inside the [Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs](https://www.government.is/ministries/ministry-of-finance-and-economic-affairs/).

These solutions are [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) and open to contributions, but most development is performed by teams that win tenders to develop new functionality for Digital Iceland.

## How to contribute

We are working on documentation and workflows to help external developers understand and run these solutions locally.

For now, we appreciate assistance with security reviews (more eyes = better), documentation and smaller fixes.

## Repository structure

The repository is a [monorepo](../technical-overview/monorepo.md) that has multiple apps (something that can be built and run) and libraries (which other apps and libraries can depend on).

Our system architecture generally includes frontend projects, a graphql API gateway, and service APIs. Many of these projects are in early development.

Featured projects:

- [Island.is website](./apps/web)
- [Application system](./apps/application-system)
- [Service Portal](./apps/service-portal)
- [Shared GraphQL API](./apps/api)
- [Island UI design system](./libs/island-ui)

Other projects:

- [Digital Judicial System](./apps/judicial-system)
- [Travel Gift](./apps/gjafakort)
- [Air Discount Scheme](./apps/air-discount-scheme)
- [COVID Activities](./apps/adgerdir)
