# Resource Oriented Design
API structure should follow Resource Oriented Design, which should facilitate 
simpler and more coherent web service interfaces, which should be easy to use
and maintain.  The data (resource) should control the design of the service. As the data is 
the key player and the service is centered around making the data accessible.



## Design flow
The fundamental idea is that the basic, well-understood, and well-known 
technologies of the current web (HTTP, URI and XML) should be used according
to their design principles. This facilitates the design of Web Services that
have simple and coherent interfaces, and which are easy to use and maintain.
Such web services will also be easier to optimize for working with the existing
infrastructure of the web.

The Resource-Oriented Architecture (ROA) consists of four concepts:

 - Resources.
 - Their names (URIs).
 - Their representations.
 - The links between them and the four properties:
   - Addressability.
   - Statelessness.
   - Connectedness.
   - A uniform interface.



The Design Guide suggests taking the following steps when designing resource- 
oriented APIs.

  - Determine what types of resources an API provides.
  - Determine the relationships between resources.
  - Decide the resource name schemes based on types and relationships.
  - Decide the resource schemas.
  - Attach minimum set of [methods] to resources, as much as possible use the standard methods(verbs).

## Resources
A resource-oriented API is generally modeled as a resource hierarchy, where 
each node is either a simple resource or a collection resource. For convenience, 
they are often called a resource and a collection, respectively.

  - A collection contains a list of resources of the same type. For example, 
    a user has a collection of photos.
  - A resource has some state and zero or more sub-resources. Each sub-resource 
    can be either a simple resource or a collection resource.

Resource name consists of the resourceâ€™s type, its identifier, the resource 
name of its parent and the name of the API service. The type is known as the
**Collection ID**, and the identifier is known as the **Resource ID**. Resource
IDs are usually random strings assigned by the API service, though it is also
OK to accept custom resource IDs from clients. **Collection ID's must be the 
plural form of the noun used for the resource** and 
**Resource ID's should be immutable**.

Below are two examples of valid resource names:

A user
```
       //my-service.island.is / users / 1
                  |               |     |
                  |               |      \
                  |               |       Resource ID
                  |                \  
                  |                 Collection ID 
                   \                   (type)
                    API service name
```

A photo
```
       //my-service.island.is / users / 1 / photos / 1
                  |               |           |      |
                  |               |           |       \
                  |               |           |        Resource ID 
                  |               |           |          (type)   
                  |               |            \  
                  |               |              Collection ID
                  |               |                 (type)
                  |                \     
                   \                Resource name of parent resource
                    API service name
       
```

Resource names are referenced throughout your API service. For HTTP RESTful 
API services, resource names will become the HTTP endpoints (HTTP URL paths); 
[gRPC API services](https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/) use these values in
the requests and responses directly.

## Fields
A resource may have one or more fields, and resources of the same type share 
the same collection of fields. For example, a resource of type users may have
field `name`, `display_name`, `email` associated with it. Note that one of 
these fields must be its resource name, a string that uniquely identifies the
resource in the service; usually field name is reserved for this purpose.

There are three types of fields:

| Type     | Description                                                                                                       |
|:---------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Required | Required fields must be populated by clients.                                                                     |
| Optional | Optional fields can be populated by clients. If left empty, they will be automatically filled by the server.      |
| Reserved | Reserved fields are only populated by server. API services should ignore user-provided values in reserved fields. |

It is up to developers themselves to determine the types of fields. There is an 
exception though: the `name` field **should always be a reserved field**.
