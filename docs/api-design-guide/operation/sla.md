# Service Level Agreement
A service level agreement (SLA) is a commitment between the service provider and a client. SLAs can be both be legally binding formal or an informal "contract", thus a SLA can be included in a contract, but a contract isn't necessarily a SLA. The agreement may involve separate organizations, or different teams within the same organization. 

Service level agreements should benefit both parties by providing absolute clarity as to what can be expected from provided services. The key to a SLAs success lies ih the metrics that are applied to determine whether the service provider is keeping their end of the bargain. 

Measurability for the service is important. Quantifiable measurements are clear and specific and are easy to devide into targets representing preferred performance. Incentives and penalties can easily be built along with clauses to indicate when customers or the service provider has the right to terminate the agreement. 

## Components of a Service Level Agreement
The details of a SLA are as varied as the service that could be covered by them, but a comprehensive SLA will usually include the following elements:
 * Service description: What does the provided service do?
 * Reliability: When is the service available?
 * Responsiveness: How quickly should services be delivered?
 * Reporting procedure: How and where to report problems? What reporting process is used in routine tasks (if applicable).
 * Performance monitoring: How will performance be monitored, who does the monitoring and how will it be measured?
 * Penalties for failure to meet obligations: What penalties will be implemented of the service provider fails to perform as outlined in the SLA.
 * Constraints: Under what circumstances will the terms of the SLA be waived?

## Service Level Agreement types
Since SLAs have many applications they have been split into categories:
* Customer-based: An agreement between the customer and the service provider, covering all the services that will be provided. 
* Service-based: An agreement for all customers using the service being provided. 
* Multilevel SLA: The SLA is split into different levels, each addressing different set of customers using a single service.

## Common metrics
* Availability: When should the service be available for use, e.g. 99,9% would mean 1 minute and 26 seconds of downtime allowed per day.
* Response time: Measurement of the time it takes to satisfy a request.
* Total pass and error rates: Measurement of success rates in terms of HTTP or other codes.
* Transactions per time period: The amount of transactions per a set time period the API endpoint must be able to handle.
